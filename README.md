# Transition

Rails app for managing the transition of websites to GOV.UK. Specifically, it's for the production of and handling
of mappings for use with [Bouncer](https://github.com/alphagov/bouncer).

## Dependencies

* Redis
* PostgreSQL 9.3+ (the app uses materialized views, which were introduced in 9.3)
    * To get PostgreSQL 9.3 in the development VM, build a new one on Trusty with
`govuk_dev_dist=trusty vagrant up`.

## Running the app

The web application itself is run like any other Rails app, for example:

```sh
script/rails s
```

In development, you can run sidekiq to process background jobs:

```sh
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

## Style guide

Available at /style, the guide documents how transition is using bootstrap, where the app has diverged from default
styles and any custom styles needed to fill in the gaps.
